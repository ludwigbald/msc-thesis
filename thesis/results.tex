\chapter{Results}
  \label{results}

\todo[inline]{
In this chapter which also could be more than one chapter, depending on the nature of the thesis, the results of the thesis are presented.
Make sure you illustrate your results with appropriate figures and tables, but do not discuss the results here. This should be done in a separate discussion chapter.
Or maybe do combine results and discussion and split by research questions.

\section{Exploratory Analysis of the Environment}
\subsection{Patterns in the Training Data}
\todo[inline]{Describe the Training Data and patterns observed}

\subsection{Discretization}
\todo[inline]{Describe the Discretization considerations}

\section{Hyperparameter Tuning}
\todo[inline]{Describe the results of hyperparameter tuning.
              Which hyperparameters are important for which algorithm?
              How much computational power did tuning take?
              How robust were the algorithms w.r.t. hyperparameter choice?}
              
\section{Comparison of different algorithms}
\todo[inline]{The main event. Results are different.}
