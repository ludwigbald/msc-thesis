  TODO: Fill with content

  - restate research question
  - summarize key findings (answer question)
  - explain and interpret results in more detail
    - relate back to other literature
    - support conclusions with data from results
    - ...
  - Discuss limitations
    - Internal Validity: Does the experiment support the conclusion?
      - Experiment was not thorough enough
      - Absence of good performance does not mean good performance is impossible, maybe I just did it wrong
      - Data was not fully used
    - External Validity: Does the conclusion generalize to real life?
      - Model limitations: Does CityLearn represent the real life application?
        - The real life application of such a system depends on technical and regulatory details
        - Data is real life, but other data might be available.
        - A real life application could have different goals than only price and CO2, like coordination goals and communication requirements.
      - 
    - Is the question important?
      - what should such a system even be judged on in application?
  - Further Research
    - Application in a real life system
